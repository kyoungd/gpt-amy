                "content": "Starrco modular buildings offer significant tax advantages due to their classification as tangible personal property. This allows them to be depreciated over 7 years, compared to the 39-year depreciation schedule for conventional buildings. This accelerated depreciation can lead to substantial tax savings. Additionally, because they are classified similarly to capital equipment, they offer more flexibility and value than traditional construction. However, it's important to consult with a tax professional for personalized advice and to review Section 179 of the tax code for detailed information.
